# Logs Analysis Assignment

This is a reporting tool that prints out reports (in plain text) based on the data in the database. This reporting tool is a Python program using the psycopg2 module to connect to the database.

The tool answers 3 questions:

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time? Which articles have been accessed the most? 
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time? That is, when you sum up all of the articles each author has written, which authors get the most page views?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?
